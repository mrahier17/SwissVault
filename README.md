SwissVault aims to act as store of value, with the same initial total supply (21,000,000) as Bitcoin.

SwissVault is a deflationary token that decreases in total supply every time a token transfer happens. As with every transfer, a percentage of the transferred amount will be burned. 

The burn rate is calculated based on the volatility of Bitcoin price.
